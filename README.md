# Financial Models Repository

This repository contains financial models that I've created for various companies and projects. The models are intended to showcase my ability to apply financial modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow (DCF), earnings projection, and comparable company analysis (Comps) using Excel.

## Models Included:

### 1. **Earnings Model for Wingstop**
   - **File:** [Earnings_Model_Wingstop.xlsx](https://github.com/soniakhamitkar/Financial_Models/blob/main/models/Earnings_Model_Wingstop.xlsx)
   - **Description:** This model estimates the future earnings for Wingstop by using historical data and financial KPIs. It includes projections for revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, and net income over the next few years.

### 2. **DCF Model for Tesla**
   - **File:** [DCF_Model_Tesla.xlsx](https://github.com/soniakhamitkar/Financial_Models/blob/main/models/DCF_Model_Tesla.xlsx)
   - **Description:** This is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model used to estimate the intrinsic value of Tesla. It includes projections for Tesla’s free cash flows, terminal value, and discounted cash flows (DCF) to calculate the company’s net present value (NPV).

### 3. **Comparable Company Analysis for JM Smucker**
   - **File:** [JM Smucker Comp_Template_SP25.xls](https://github.com/soniakhamitkar/Financial_Models/blob/main/models/JM%20Smucker%20Comp%20Template%20SP25.xls)
